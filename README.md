Edit
public fun send_tip(sender: &signer, recipient: address, amount: u64) acquires TipBox

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
A recipient must have a TipBox initialized before receiving tips.

If borrow_global_mut<TipBox> fails, it means the recipient‚Äôs TipBox is missing.

This module currently works only with AptosCoin. You can extend it for other coins by replacing the AptosCoin type.
